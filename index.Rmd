Hello,

I'm a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Washington University in St Louis. I study how membrane proteins associate within lipid bilayers -- yes, it is highly likely that I show you a movie of a protein jiggling half way through my talk. I love computational biophysics, coding, teaching & learning and talking about any of these topics!   
<br> </br>
I completed my MSc degree (in Computational Sciences and Engineering) at [Koc University](https://eng.ku.edu.tr/en/academics/interdisciplinary-graduate-programs/computational-sciences-and-engineering/) and my PhD (in Physics) at [Concordia University](http://www.concordia.ca/artsci/physics.html). My PhD thesis focuses on molecular modelling of ion channels and transporters.

A quick note: I built this website using the amazing tutorial by [Emily C. Zabor](http://www.emilyzabor.com/tutorials/rmarkdown_websites_tutorial.html) `r emo::ji("heart")`.
